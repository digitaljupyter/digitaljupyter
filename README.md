Hello. I'm Kai Gonzalez, a professional at *seeming* professional. That's all I'm good at.

At this point, I know so many programming languages it's hard to choose one to use.

I ***barely*** know HTML & CSS, masterful at JavaScript, and any other *-Script*, and I know a lot of other languages like D, C++, and I've made my own.


<h2 align="center">On a more friendly note...</h2>

I'm bisexual, a furry, and I enjoy watching YouTube and exploring different programming languages and learning how they work.
